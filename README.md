# 🚗 Road Lane Line Detection System 🛣️

Welcome to the **Road Lane Line Detection System** repository! This project uses **Computer Vision and Deep Learning** techniques to detect lane lines on the road, making it a step toward safer and more advanced driver-assistance technologies.

---

## 📝 Overview

In this project, we've developed a system that:
- 🚥 Detects lane lines in road images or videos.
- 📸 Utilizes **image processing techniques** like edge detection, region selection, and line approximation.
- 🧠 Employs **deep learning models** for robust lane line detection.

The main goal is to aid autonomous driving systems by accurately identifying lane markings, which is a crucial part of navigation and safety.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **🖼️ Image Preprocessing**: The system reads images or video frames, converting them into grayscale 🖤 and applying a **Gaussian blur** 🌫️ to reduce noise.
2. **🔍 Edge Detection**: Uses **Canny Edge Detection** 🖤➖ to identify prominent edges in the frame, helping to outline the lane lines.
3. **📐 Region Selection**: A **Region of Interest (ROI)** is selected 🗺️ to focus the detection on relevant road areas, ensuring the system only analyzes where lane lines are expected.
4. **🧠 Lane Line Detection**: The processed frame is fed into a deep learning model for lane line identification, using the **Hough Transform** ➖➖ and other algorithms for accurate, real-time lane detection.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- **Curve Detection**: Improve the model's capability to handle curved lanes.
- **Real-time Performance**: Enhance processing speed for real-time applications.
- **Weather Adaptability**: Improve lane detection in diverse weather conditions (rain, fog, etc.)
